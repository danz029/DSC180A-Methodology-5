Section A09 with mentor Armin Schwartzman

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
   - For me, the process of performing a brain scan with an fMRI machine was the most interesting, especially since we got to see it happen in person.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
   - I'd like to investigate more into the results from the brain scan of one of our group members. It would be interesting to perform analysis on a brain scan dataset that we obtained ourselves.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
   - Ideally, I would like to start early and perform the actual analysis part of the project in the middle of the quarter instead of at the end.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
  - We've decided to use PCA, ICA, and pairwise correlation in time series, but I would also be interested in using autocorrelation in our project.
